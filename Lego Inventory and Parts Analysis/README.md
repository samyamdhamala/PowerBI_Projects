# ðŸ§± Lego Analytics Dashboard  

This project analyzes **Lego datasets** by building relational models and interactive reports in Power BI.  
The goal was to connect multiple datasets (inventories, sets, parts, categories, and colors) and surface insights into Lego products, inventories, and part distributions.

## ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling  
- Loaded six datasets into Power BI Desktop:  
  - `inventories`  
  - `sets`  
  - `inventory_parts`  
  - `parts`  
  - `part_categories`  
  - `colors`  
- Built relationships between tables in **Model View**.  
- Cleaned incorrect or duplicate relationships, ensuring a reliable data schema.

## ðŸ“Š Report Development  
- Designed interactive visuals to explore:  
  - Lego sets and their inventories.  
  - Breakdown of Lego parts by category.  
  - Color distribution of pieces across sets.  
- Report formatting:  
  - Consistent background color.  
  - Borders ON with **rounded corners (10px)**.  
  - Shadows ON for depth.  
  - Customized titles and aligned text.  
- Added styled textbox with author name and date.
